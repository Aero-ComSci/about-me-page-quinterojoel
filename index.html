    <h1>About Me - Joel Quintero</h1>
    <img src="ME.jpg" alt="Me">
    <h2>My goals</h2>
    <p>My goals are heavilly influenced by my father. My father worked as a hardware engineer. I was always interested in being a software engineer because of this. I plan on taking as many courses I can to understand more about computer science to become software engineer.</p>
    <h2>My strengths</h2>
    <p>I am a very enthusiastic person who doesn't get discouraged easily when faced with a difficult task or situation. I like taking risks as well. I am very patient when it comes to solving a long difficult task. I am also always looking for feedback to improve.</p>
    <h2>My achievements</h2>
    <p>Though high school just began, I have participated in many different things. I have ran cross country and plan on joining track and field. I also am looking to join clubs so I can get a better understanding on things I am interested in. These clubs are mostly to do with electronics and code.</p>
    <h2>My abilities</h2>
    <p>From what I've learned about myself from joining sports and participating in clubs, I've found that I work well with others. In other words I do well when working with others towards one goal. I enjoy things that include teamwork and communication with others. I also found that I work more efficiently with others than on my own.</p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Thanks for taking your time to find out more about me. I look foward to recieving any feedback or suggestions for improving.</p>
